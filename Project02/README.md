#For my Resume Webpage, there are five parts:basic information, education, work experience, award and self assessment.

#The variable body -- to set up the line height, width, and color.
#.main_border -- to make a frame of my resume.
#.blod -- to make the letters bold. (I typed wrong at beginning, so I did not change the name)
#.section -- to set up the background of each part with same color with the main border.
#.section_title -- the font and padding of the title in each part.
#.section-1 -- the font and padding of subtitle in each part.
#.section-2 -- similar with section-1 with same size but different padding.
