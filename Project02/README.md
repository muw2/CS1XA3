#Part 1 CV Webpage

#For my Resume Webpage, there are five parts:basic information, education, work experience, award and self assessment.

#The variable body -- to set up the line height, width, and color.
#.main_border -- to make a frame of my resume.
#.blod -- to make the letters bold. (I typed wrong at beginning, so I did not change the name)
#.section -- to set up the background of each part with same color with the main border.
#.section_title -- the font and padding of the title in each part.
#.section-1 -- the font and padding of subtitle in each part.
#.section-2 -- similar with section-1 with same size but different padding.
#.section-3 -- similar with section-2 and including line height because this is used for a paragraph.

#for the body part run the main border first and then set up each part's background. Following that, the first part is the information about myself.
#The second part is education(university, major).
#The third part is work experience(I list 3 different types jobs)
#The fourth part is award(I list 2 awards)
#The last part is me self assessment.

#For each part I draw a line below the title.
#there are two colors i used, background is #f2efe6, for the letters is #78756c.
