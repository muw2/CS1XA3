#My project feature

#5.1 Script Input
#For this part I get the input from user to check a integer is positive/negative and odd/even. Following that, I ask the user's name, gender, age and sport the user like and give an output.

#5.2 Create a TODO Log
#I touch a todo.log first.
#Secondly, I put each line of every file in my repo with the tag #TODO into a file todo.log.
